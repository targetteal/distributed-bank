# Lessons Learned: Distributed Bank Implementation

## Authentication System Implementation

### 1. User Registration Flow
- **Form Validation Strategy**
  - Using Zod with React Hook Form provides robust, type-safe validation
  - Client-side validation improves user experience with immediate feedback
  - Password requirements (uppercase, lowercase, numbers) enhance security

### 2. Supabase Integration
- **Email Confirmation Flow**
  - Supabase handles email verification automatically
  - Need to configure redirect URLs in Supabase dashboard
  - Important to handle the auth callback route properly (`/auth/callback`)

### 3. Authentication State Management
- **Session Handling**
  - Supabase manages auth state through cookies
  - Client-side components can access auth state via `supabase.auth.getUser()`
  - Important to handle loading states while checking authentication

### 4. Routing and Protection
- **Protected Routes**
  - Dashboard requires authentication
  - Unauthenticated users are redirected to login
  - Auth state determines available navigation options

### 5. Security Considerations
- **Environment Variables**
  - Supabase credentials must be kept secure
  - Use `.env.local` for local development
  - Never commit sensitive credentials to version control

### 6. User Experience
- **Feedback and Loading States**
  - Show loading indicators during authentication operations
  - Clear error messages help users understand issues
  - Success messages confirm completed actions

### 7. Code Organization
- **Component Structure**
  - Separate authentication components for maintainability
  - Keep form logic isolated from presentation
  - Reuse validation schemas across components

### 8. Testing Approach
- **Authentication Testing**
  - Unit tests for form validation
  - Component tests for UI behavior
  - Mock Supabase auth calls in tests

### 9. Testing React Components and Hooks
- **React 18 Testing Compatibility**
  - Update testing libraries to support React 18
  - Remove deprecated methods like `waitForNextUpdate`
  - Use modern testing patterns with `@testing-library/react`

### 10. Dependency Management Challenges
- **NPM Peer Dependency Issues**
  - Complex projects can have conflicting package requirements
  - Use `--legacy-peer-deps` to resolve version conflicts
  - Regularly update and audit dependencies to minimize conflicts

### 11. Authentication Hook Testing
- **Mocking External Services**
  - Mock Supabase authentication methods in tests
  - Simulate different authentication scenarios
  - Test error handling and routing logic
  - Ensure comprehensive test coverage for authentication flows

## Next Steps and Improvements
1. Implement multi-factor authentication
2. Add role-based access control
3. Enhance error handling and recovery flows
4. Add password reset functionality
5. Implement session timeout handling
